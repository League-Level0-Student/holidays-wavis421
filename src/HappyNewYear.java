		// 7. Repeat steps 2 to 6 (10 times)

			// 2. Make a variable 'sum' and initialize to 0

			
			// 3. Repeat steps 4 to 6 (500 times) 

				// 4. Get a random number between 0 and 50

				
				// 5. If sum is less than newYear then add your random
				//    number to your sum, otherwise subtract it.
				

				// 6. If your sum matches newYear, then print the number of tries
				//    to the console and use the "break" statement to exit the loop
				

		
		// *** BONUS: Keep track of your best score and worst score, and print
		//            the results to the console.
